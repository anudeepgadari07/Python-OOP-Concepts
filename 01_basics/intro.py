'''OOPS - Object Oriented Programming is a Paradigm/Approach to programming.
It is a way of organizing code where data(attributes) and functions(methods) are combained
together in a class. It models real world entities as software objects that emphazies 
relationship,encapsulation,inheritance and polymorphism.

Advantages:
Provides a clear structure to programs.
Make code easier to maintain ,reuse and debug.
Real-World Modeling :OOP models real-world entities naturally.
Encapsulation restricts direct access to data and protects it using private variables.
    Why it matters:
    Prevents accidental modification
    Improves security
    Keeps internal logic safe
Abstraction shows only necessary details and hides complex implementation.
    Why it matters:
    Reduces mental load
    Cleaner interfaces
    Easier to use complex systems
Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties of another.
    Why it matters:
    Reduces code duplication
    Makes systems extensible
    Promotes hierarchical design
Polymorphism allows the same method name to behave differently.
    Why it matters:
    More flexible code
    Easier to extend features
    Cleaner interfaces

Disadvangaes:
More Complex Design
Larger Code Size
Not Always Suitable for small or computation-heavy programs if overengineered.
