'''
Class :-
Class is a Object constructor "or" a blueprint for creating objects.
To create a class, use the keyword "class"
Example:
Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
class MyClass:
  x = 5

Object :-
Object is a instance created from class
Creating an object named p1, and printing the value of x:
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)

"Note": Each object is independent and has its own copy of the class properties.
